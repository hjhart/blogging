Introduce the Problem - 
How do we solve the problem with our servers?
We can use a similar toolset for our workstations. (people at your company probably already have experience with this, too)
Introduction to solution
Along with solution, these are the perks:
* Convergent workstations - exact same aliases, configarations, applications, toolchest.
* Fix on one workstation fixes everywhere.
* Benefit of open source at yuor disposal to solve the same problem you will. ( Active codebase)
* The same settings you change on fresh machines – those hvae already been removed! 
* Manage common workstation configuration like git and ssh configuration. Think dotfiles, but souped up.
